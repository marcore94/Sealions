Problem formulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed project consisted in the implementation of a convolutional
 neural network for the classification of sea lions using pictures extracted
 from aerial images.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The idea of the project is based on a Kaggle competition featured in 2017
 (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count
\end_layout

\end_inset

) where the objective was to provide a sea lions population count using
 fully convolutional neural network to analyze the aerial images taken by
 drones.
 Moreover it was required also to distinguish five classes among sea lions
 based on age and sex: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
adult male
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
adult female
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
subadult male
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
juvenile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
puppy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original aim of this competition was to automatize work done by biologist
 to keep track of the sea lions population.
 This manual work takes up to four months to count sea lions from those
 images.
 Due to this long time needed, automatizing this work would allow biologist
 to focus more on sea lions problems, rather on this counting task.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The requirement assigned to our group for the project was to provide a classifie
r that was able to distinguish only 2 classes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sea lion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
without any distinction between the sea lions subclasses.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To accomplish to the task we used the dataset provided by kaggle that included,
 for each image, the ground truth expressed as a point centered on each
 sea lion with different colors for the different classes.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision since it
 forms the basis for other computer vision tasks such as localization, detection
, and segmentation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Although the task can be considered second nature for humans, it is much
 more challenging for an automated system.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Traditionally handcrafted features were first extracted from images using
 feature descriptors, and these served as input to a trainable classifier,
 in this way the accuracy of the classification task was profoundly dependent
 on the design of the feature extraction stage, and this usually proved
 to be a difficult task that required domain experts
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-7"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In recent years, deep learning models that exploit multiple layers of nonlinear
 information processing, for feature extraction and transformation as well
 as for pattern analysis and classification, have been shown to overcome
 these challenges.
 Among them, CNNs have become the leading architecture for most image recognitio
n, classification, and detection tasks

\begin_layout Section
Convolutional Neural Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CNNs are feedforward networks in that information flow takes place in one
 direction only, from their inputs to their outputs.
 Just as artificial neural networks (ANN) are biologically inspired, so
 are CNNs.
 The visual cortex in the brain, which consists of alternating layers of
 simple and complex cells, motivates their architecture 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-5,key-6"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 CNN architectures come in several variations, however, in general, they
 consist of convolutional and pooling (or subsampling) layers, which are
 grouped into modules.
 Either one or more fully connected layers, as in a standard feedforward
 neural network, follow these modules.
 Modules are often stacked on top of each other to form a deep model.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Despite some early sucesses
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-8,key-9,key-11"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, deep CNN were brought into the limelight as a result of the deep learning
 reanaissance
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-12,key-13,key-14"

\end_inset

, which was fueled by GPUs, larger data sets and better algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-16,key-3,key-1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Several advances such as GPUs implementations and the application of maximum
 pooling have contributed to the recent popularity.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The most significant advance, which has captured intense interest in DCNNs,
 especially for image classification tasks, was achieved in the ImageNet
 Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, DCNNs have dominated subsequent versions of the ILSVRC and,
 more specifically, its image classification component

 In addition to these advances, other improvements affected the performances

 in fact convnets are not only improving whole-image classification tasks

\begin_layout Section
Fully convolutional networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the astonishing results in the aforementioned topics, the natural
 next step in the progression from coarse to fine inference yields to pixelwise
 prediction.
 A prior approach used convnets for semantic segmentation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-29,key-30,key-31,key-32,key-33,key-34,key-35"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, however, during the training phase, this required that in the ground truth
 each pixel was labeled with the class of its enclosing object or region
 in the ground.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An important advance in this sense was introduced by fully convolutional
 neural networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-36"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: the key idea was to extend convnets to arbitrary-sized inputs by model
 transfer.
 Differently from previous approaches that was based on sliding windows
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, separately computed feature extractors

Typical recognition nets were realized to take fixed-size inputs and produce
 non spatial outputs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1,key-3,key-18"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the fully connected layers of these networks had fixed dimensions and
 threw away spatial coordinates.
 These fully connected layers can also be viewed as convolutions with kernels
 that cover the entire input regions, doing so it's possible to cast them
 into fully convolutional networks that take inputs of any size and give
 as outputs the classification maps
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-36"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Since the classification nets subsample to keep filters small and computational
 requirements reasonable, the output of a fully convolutional version of
 these nets results coarsen, reducing it from the size of the input by a
 factor equal to the pixel stride of the receptive fields of the output
 units.
 To cope with this problem and connect coarse outputs to dense pixels interpolat
ion by upsampling can be adopted.
 Upsampling can be implemented by deconvolution and learned by backpropagation
 of the pixelwise loss

\begin_layout Chapter
Solution Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main idea for this project is to realize a Deep CNN classifier that
 is able to distinguish sea lions from their habitat, the choice of a Deep
 CNN is due to the great results that they can achive in this kind of tasks
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1,key-3,key-19"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The successive step will be to extend the classifier to a Fully CNN 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-36"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, in this way the object detection task proposed by the orginal Kaggle competiti
on can be pursued.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Images in the provided data set were taken from drones, thus they are very
 large and contains a lot of sea lions and different background areas.
 Due to the impossibility of using the whole images to train the network,
 the first step was to create a suitable training dataset.
 To do this, we extracted both sea lions centered patches and background
 patches by cropping the images provided in the original data set and trained
 the binary classifier on these patches.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

After having extracted them, we decided to apply data augmentation to obtain
 a more robust classifier.
 This allowed us to increase a lot the dimension of the original dataset,
 in particular for what concerns sea lions patches.
 In fact, due to the nature of the images, they contained much more background
 patches than sea lions ones.
 By data augmentation we were able to overcome, partially, this unbalance
 and to obtain better performance during testing phase because it makes
 the classifier more insensitive to position, rotation and scaling.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Once performances over patches were satisfying, we moved to an higher level,
 modifying the network to take as input the whole image and providing an
 heatmap of it.
 This gives the possibility, given an image, to see where and how sea lions
 are distributed in the environment and to compute an estimate of how many
 sea lions are present in that image.

Dataset creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing to do with images provided by Kaggle is to divide them in
 train and test set, in particular the first 
\begin_inset Formula $750$
\end_inset

 images were used for training and the remaining ones (from 
\begin_inset Formula $751$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $947$
\end_inset

) for testing.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The extraction of patches from Kaggle images has been done performing the
 absolute difference between the original image and its corresponding one
 with colored dots on the sea lions, in this way it’s possible to gather
 from each image coordinates and class of all the sea lions.

Given these coordinates it’s easy to cut from the original images a 
\begin_inset Formula $96\times96$

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To extract the background we used a sliding window of size 
\begin_inset Formula $96\times96$

 over the image and cut all the patches which were not intersecting with
 a sea lion patch and save them with label ‘background’.
\end_layout

 ‘sea lions’ and

 and

 The test set instead has 
\begin_inset Formula $13539$

 ‘background’ patches.
 Given this dataset divided into classes, train, validation and test set
 it’s possible to train the model.

As can be seen from these two images avoiding balck patches is fundamental
 to have a correct dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the extraction procedure has been fully completed and all its related
 problems have been solved, we detected new problems related to the patches
 themselves.
 First of all, if we used the 
\begin_inset Formula $40411$
\end_inset

 sea lion patches, what happens is that they might not be sufficient to
 correctly classify a sea lion.
 Also, the two classes are really unbalanced, there are a lot more background
 patches than sea lion ones.
 So, if we used all the patches, there was the risk of overfitting over
 the sea lions ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

Data augmentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained before, to increase the dimension of the dataset and generalize
 more over position, rotation and scale we applied data augmentation to
 the sea lions patches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-39"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This technique has been applied to solve the problems related to the dataset
 that came up after patches extraction 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Dataset-creation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, in fact it allows to expand the dataset creating new patches modifying
 the extracted ones, this is fundamental especially due to the poorness
 that characterize the sea lion class.
 Moreover, training a model with augmented patches makes it more robust
 and consistent in classifying previously unseen samples.
 In particular, what we applied is a random combination of four transformations
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-40"
literal "false"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rotation of a random degree in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

\begin_inset Formula $360$

 degrees

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

 pixels, both vertically and horizontally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Zooming of a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $20$
\end_inset

 pixels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transformation process is, as said before, completely random so the
 number of new patches that can be generated is really high, that's why
 with these transformations is possible to overcome the problem of lack
 of sea lion patches and class unbalance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first implementation we tried for the augmentation procedure was to
 build our own handcrafted tool which behaved exactly as described before.
 This tool was built to receive as input higher size sea lion patches (
\begin_inset Formula $144\times144$

) to avoid interpolation of eventual missing pixels due to the transformations
 and to have a final transformed patch as much precise as possible.
 Of course patches must be modified at runtime, during the network training,
 because it's impossible to save all the patches that can be generated with
 augmentation.
 At this point we noticed that this handcrafted tool was not as fast as
 expected so we decided to replace it with the Keras built-in data generator
 which allows to apply augmentation as well.
 Data generator provided by Keras doesn't require bigger patches as input
 beacuse automatically applies interpolation to fill eventual missing pixels
 and mantain sizes of the input image.
 With this augmentation tool the process of loading modified patches at
 runtime speeded up consistently while the applied transformations are the
 same, so the whole train process became less time consuming.

Batch generator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting from the second implementation of the network we added a custom
 batch generator to improve memory management and handle augmentation.
 This was a necessary consequence of the training approach we adopted, in
 fact for what concerns the sea lion patches we decided to leave in memory
 both the training and validation sets, while for what concerns background
 patches, due to the huge amount, only the validation set was maintained.
 On the other hand, the training patches were instead periodically reloaded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, to take advantage of Keras queue system for batch processing,
 we actually performed augmentation just before yielding the batch to the
 queue, in this way the training could proceed without waiting that the
 entire data set of the current epoch had undergone transformations and
 we avoided to fill all the memory.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To be more precise, the first step was to load the entire validation set.
 Subsequently all the sea lions patches from the training set were loaded
 in memory as soon as the first batch request was dispatched and then periodical
ly, an equal amount of background patches from the train set was randomly
 sampled and loaded.
 At this point augmentation was applied batch-wise until the end of the
 training.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A key problem related to memory management was that even though pixels required
 
\begin_inset Formula $8bit$
\end_inset

 for each color channel, since we needed to normalize the values in a 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 range we were forced to use a 
\begin_inset Formula $32bit$
\end_inset

 floating point representation that would make the current data sets four
 times bigger.
 Thankfully as a side effect of the use of batch generator only the current
 batch images were changed to that representation avoiding the explosion
 of required memory.

Object Detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as the CNN building and training phases ended the fully convolutional
 model extraction could proceed.
 To do so the fully connected final layer was reshaped to another convolutional
 layer maintaining the same connections and related weights of the original
 network, the new final convolutional layer used 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 filters (one for each label) and a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 kernel, with a softmax activation function.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Since the constraints on the input shape were dropped it was possible to
 feed an entire image to the network that produced as output two heatmaps
 that highlighted respectively the pixels belonging to the sea lion and
 the background classes according to the probabilities predicted by the
 classifier.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is important to stress out that any shift-and-stitch or upsampling via
 deconvolution to yield the dense predictions was used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-41"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, instead was applied a simple interpolation to the results.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The final step was to use the computed heatmap of an entire image to locate
 all the sea lions.
 To do so at first the heatmap was hard thresholded (with pixel probabilty
 threshold set to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.9$
\end_inset

) then, in order to have a clearer distinction from the background, a blob
 detector based on the Laplacian of the Gaussian was applied to results
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Given an input image 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset

, this image is convolved by a Gaussian kernel
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(x,y,t)=\frac{1}{2\pi t}e^{-\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2t}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the scale give a scale space representation.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L(x,y;t)=g(x,y,t)\times f(x,y)
\]

\end_inset

Then, the result of applying the Laplacian operator
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nabla^{2}L=L_{xx}+L_{yy}
\]

\end_inset

is computed, which usually results in strong positive responses for blobs
 of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\sqrt{2t}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Since this technique presents some problems with automatic detection of
 blobs with different (unknown) size in the image domain, the normalization
 of the Laplacian was adopted alongside a multi-scale approach implemented
 by defining a range in which the different possible scales could be tested.
\begin_inset Newline newline

In the end the points of interest 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{x},\hat{y})$

In order to perform the tasks required we developed the project in Python,
 using PyCharm IDE.
 In particular, we used Jupyter notebooks that allowed to write the code
 and to execute it section by section, in this way we were able to monitor
 the results as soon as each step was completed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thanks to the choice of Python we managed to use Keras, an high-level neural
 networks API, with the TensorFlow framework as backend.
 The choice of Keras helped to simplify the development while TensorFlow
 allowed us to take advantage of GPU acceleration that sped up the entire
 training process significantly.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Another aspect that characterized the development was the use of dataframes
 that allowed a better management of all the informations about the data
 set.

\begin_layout Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental activity started by extracting patches in order to create a
 train set.
 By applying the procedure explained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Dataset-creation"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we obtained a train set including 
\begin_inset Formula $50079$
\end_inset

 ‘sea lions’ and 
\begin_inset Formula $1139531$
\end_inset

 ‘background’ patches which are split again in 
\begin_inset Formula $40411$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $9668$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1129863$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $9668$
\end_inset

 respectively for proper train and validation procedures.
 The test set instead has 
\begin_inset Formula $13539$
\end_inset

 ‘sea lions’ and 
\begin_inset Formula $277390$
\end_inset

 ‘background’ patches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from the numbers of extracted patches the dataset is heavily
 unbalanced and there are a lot more background patches than sea lion ones.
 Rather than using all the background patches, we decided as a first attempt
 to randomly sample them and produce a balanced train set.
 Extracted sea lions patches were 
\begin_inset Formula $50079$
\end_inset

, so an equal number of background patches were taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reduced dimensions of the used train set, allowed it to be fit all in
 memory, producing good performances in terms of minutes per epoch.
 Thus we could train the network for 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 epochs using a learning rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.001$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing of the model trained in this way was performed using a balanced
 test set, using once as before the total number of sea lions patches as
 an upper bound to the background ones.

\begin_layout Section
Batch generator and augmentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that, we decided to use the whole dataset both for training and testing
 rather than a balanced one because the real problem is to identify sea
 lions among a lot of background.
 This caused different problems, in particular due to memory usage and to
 high number of background patches with respect to sea lions ones.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Memory related problems were linked to the fact that training dataset was
 of some Gigabytes, thus it couldn’t fit all in the memory at the same time.
 To overcome this we created a batch generator which, as explained in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Batch-generator"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, retrieved a limited number of patches from the memory and fed them to
 the network at each epoch.
 In this way only a little amount of patches were moved into the RAM at
 the same time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This generator also enabled us to introduce data augmentation in this training
 step.
 It was needed due to the high difference in number between sea lions and
 background patches and also to obtain more robust results in classification,
 see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data-augmentation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for more details.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To train the network we used the generator to create a balanced data set
 composed of all the sea lions patches with augmentation and an equal number
 of background patches randomly sampled from all the background patches.
 This dataset is used for one epoch and then changed, creating a new one
 with the same criteria.
 In this way the network sees all the sea lions patches different times
 but overfitting is prevented by the wide amount of modifications introduced
 by the augmentation.
 While the background patches are used in an efficient way because network
 sees a wide variety of them while keeping the procedure memory efficient.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Although these premises, results were not good and the network very bad,
 being not so better with respect to a random classifier.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This training allowed us to identify three new problems: changing the dataset
 at each epoch is time consuming, because loading the patches from disk
 to memory is a bottleneck in the whole procedure; moreover due to the handcraft
ed augmentation tool even the batch creation was slowed down; puppies are
 really hard to be identified by the network, with their color and shape
 can be easily mistaken as background also by human eye.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Given that this training was particularly time consuming for the reasons
 discussed before, the network was trained for only 
\begin_inset Formula $30$
\end_inset

 epochs with a 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0005$
\end_inset

 learning rate.
 The procedure took a lot of time and was not sufficient to learn enough
 from the data provided.

As shown by the following tables the presence of a much higher number of
 background patches influenced a lot the metrics used to estimate the model
 performances, in particular while the accuracy was still close to that
 of the previous training the AUC shows a significant drop and gets close
 to 0.5 (the random classifier limit).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can also directly compare the accuracy of this training with the previous
 one.
 If we restrict the analysis to the first 30 epochs and on the validation
 set, to have a meaningful comparison, the first training provides an accuracy
 of about 
\begin_inset Formula $96.6\%$
\end_inset

, while this one only of the 
\begin_inset Formula $91.38\%$
\end_inset

 Also, the variation of accuracy from the beginning of the training is about

Keras augmentation and puppies exclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this further modifications was to solve all the problems
 that came up in the previous one.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The first adjustment was to change the generator and make it reload a different
 dataset from memory every 15 epochs and not at each epoch.
 This choice speeded up the whole training phase allowing us to train for
 more epochs.
 The problem related to puppies was solved analyzing where and how they
 appear in the images, in fact it can be noticed that this particular class
 is often next to a female sea lion.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thanks to this information we were able to apply a second important change:
 remove puppies from the dataset.
 In this way for the network it’s easier to learn and distinguish between
 all the other classes of sea lions and the background so it’s possible
 to achieve better performances.
 At the end, in the final result, the number of puppies can be estimated
 from the number of sea lions detected.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Another remarkable difference with respect to the last training was that
 we dropped the handcrafted augmentation tool in favor of Keras built-in
 one that enabled a much higher throughput in the creation of the training
 batches, as seen in section

We also performed some testing in the case of a balanced test set.
 Here are reported the results in this case and we can see that the precision
 in classification of sea lions increases highly with respect to the unbalanced
 test set case.
 On the other hand, there is a slight decrease in the precision of background
 classification.

As can be seen looking at the misclassified patches, the errors committed
 by the network are reasonable, in fact sometimes there are sea lions whose
 color and shape is hardly distinguishable from the background therefore
 are classified as background.
 In other cases rocks or stones have color and shape such that they are
 interpreted as sea lions by the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Object detection and sea lions counting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point we took the last trained network and, as explained before
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Object-Detection"

\end_inset

, replaced the last fully connected layer with a convolutional one maintaining
 all the weights.
 With this reshaped network we are able to evaluate an entire image and
 obtain a heatmap highlighting zone where is more probable to have a sea
 lion.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Then we decided to apply a threshold on the heatmap to create a grayscale
 image with white zones corresponding to sea lions.
 On this new image it was possible to apply blob detection, refined through
 parameter tuning as for the heatmap threshold, to have a rough count of
 how many sea lions are present in the considered image.
 To do so we used the built in function from the scikit-learn library and
 after some tests we decided for the following parameters:

Sea lions counting based on blobs
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

As can be seen from these numbers, even if the prediction on the nuber of
 sea lions isn't performed with a deeply studied strategy, final results
 aren't too bad.
 In particular, looking at figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Detected-sea-lions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, can be noticed that some animals are not covered by blobs and there are
 some mistaken blobs over the background, therefore we can say this method
 is not the best to count sea lions with high precision due to the presence
 of these errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another final consideration that can be done is that the predicted number
 is clearly an overestimate of the real one, but the presence of puppies,
 which are not considered in this network, makes the two nubers be closer
 one to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work done for this project produced a convolutional neural network able
 to achieve good performance on the classification of sea lions over background.
 In particular we want to point out how the two major enhancements we did
 to improve the performance of the network, i.e.
 data augmentation and the management of the dataset during the training,
 have actually set out the condition for a good classification.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The first approach to augmentation didn’t produce the expected results.
 This was mainly caused by the high variety of data introduced by it and
 the complexity for the network to learn it.
 In fact, the high computational cost of the training didn’t allow us to
 run an high number of epochs.
 Thus, the benefits of augmentation were overcome by its disadvantages.
 After we introduced generator and by it optimized the memory usage, we
 found out that the augmentation provided the expected improvements.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are still some open problems linked to this project.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

First of all we have overcome the recognition of puppies due to the intrinsic
 difficulty of the task.
 Further works could reintroduce them with a correct classification.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Our task was to produce a binary classifier which could distinguish between
 a sea lion and the background.
 An extension to this could be a multiclass classifier which can effectively
 recognise among the classes of the original competition.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Another approach that could produce an improvement in the results is to
 exploit transfer learning from models trained with imageNet, for example,
 since they provide optimal performances in low level feature extraction

\begin_inset Newline newline

The last thing we imagine could work better is a direct object recognition
 approach without going through the classification task, however this would
 require a much more detailed ground truth
